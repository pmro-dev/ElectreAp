ElectreAp is a code implementation of Electre III Algorithm that is uses to solve multicriterial problems. 

Implementation was created as My Bachelor Science Degree project (diploma thesis) at University Of Rzeszow (Poland).

Genesis and the main goal of thesis
The main goal of that project was to develop a Windows Application for ordering alternatives 
and thus supporting decisions based on implementation of ELECTRE III Algorithm in multicriterial decision problems.

Application allows to preview results obtained at each execution steps (algorithm steps) 
with mathematical theory corresponding to each steps. This simplify analizing, learning and understanding how algorithm works. 
By this project has a didactic properties, which is an additional goal of the work.

The "ELECTRE" term is an acronym for "ELiminiation Et Choix Traduisant 
la REalite". This name is used to qualify a sort of decision support algorithms, that have come from France. 
The Major creator of ELECTRE family is Bernard Roy, who introduced them in the 60's of XX century.
